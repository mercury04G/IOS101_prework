## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
### Favorite Apps
- Outlook
 - Automatic response
 - Calendar available to share with coworkers
- Reddit
 - Joining new groups/communities and knowing others' opinions
 - High-quality recommendations
- Safari
 - Syncing data by Apple account
 - Protecting users' privacy

### App Idea
I would like to create an accounting app that fetches data from all cards of users. 
The idea comes from my personal experience of using several credit and debit cards from different banks.
It is inconvenient to check them and add them to one sheet manually, 
so I want to design an app to do the task automatically.
#### Features
- Autofill your transaction data from CSV and Xls files downloaded from multiple bank accounts.
- Enable users to fill up data manually
- Enable customized categories of transaction
- Set spending and saving goals

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
